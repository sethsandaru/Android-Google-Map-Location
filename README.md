# Android-Google-Map-Location
An Android java project implement the Google Maps API and Google Location API.

In this project, I researched how to implement the Google Maps API into an android project, show the maps, add the marker, information in marker, find location by using Google Location API and add spetific location into the map(like ATM, Bank, Hospital,...)

## Technologies
1. Android (API 18+)
2. Java
3. Google Maps API (Async map, newest)
4. Google Location API (Google Map Services - Java client)

## Note:
+ Please use Android Studio 3.x to open this project, lower version can't open this project :D
